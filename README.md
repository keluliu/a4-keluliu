[VercelLink](https://a4-keluliu.vercel.app)

The To-Do List Manager is a full-stack web application that allows users to create, update, categorize, and delete their tasks efficiently. It supports user authentication (local and GitHub OAuth), task filtering, and sorting by due date, creation date, and description. Users can only view and manage their own tasks, ensuring personalized task management.
